Awesome job with your Setup of milestones.
A little help would be to either add the task break down or not. 
Becasue you have some that had it and some that didn't.

Also All of your userstories should have more than one acceptance criteria. 

Title your userstory and task as follows (please)
Userstory 4 consistent UI
Task 4.1 Integrate backend components
Task 4.2 General UI
etc..


Please put assignment 5 into your repository as a zip file.
Sincerely,
C. Albert Thompson
