For information about Project progress and design see our wiki.

We added additional acceptance criteria criteria have standardize the tasks. 
To facilitate task tracking we have remove the specific tasks from each
description. To view tasks click on the browse issues link in the milestone
tab per issue. We have done this so that tasks are easier to add, remove and
edit as the project evolves. Otherwise, if a tasks for a user story is changed
then we will have to make a text change in 3 locations.

Assignment 5 info: In addition to the zip file we should have included a 
detailed description in the wiki. I should be easier to mark us if you take
a look at the wiki.

TA Comments
=======
Awesome job with your Setup of milestones.
A little help would be to either add the task break down or not. 
Becasue you have some that had it and some that didn't.

Also All of your userstories should have more than one acceptance criteria. 

Title your userstory and task as follows (please)
Userstory 4 consistent UI
Task 4.1 Integrate backend components
Task 4.2 General UI
etc..


Please put assignment 5 into your repository as a zip file.
Sincerely,
C. Albert Thompson
(the TA that is grading you)
